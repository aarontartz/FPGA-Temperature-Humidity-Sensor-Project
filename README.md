# FPGA Temperature Sensor Project

First ever Vivado project, planned and developed in 2 weeks in March 2024

*Looking back 6 months later, if I were to redo this project, I would incorporate a mix of combinational and sequential code in my "i2c_master.v" module as I did in my UART project in my "Digital-Logic-Projects" repository to make my Verilog more legible
