# FPGA Temperature Sensor Project

First ever Vivado/Verilog project, planned and developed in 2 weeks in March 2024

*Looking back 6 months later, if I were to redo this project, I would make the code in my "i2c_master.v" module similar to my UART (another serial communication protocol) project in my "Digital-Logic-Projects" repository to make my Verilog more legible. This project, being my introduction to Verilog, does not contain the most elegant code and is admittedly a bit brute-forced to fit the Si7021 I2C protocol...

*If anyone looking at this in the future would like me to rewrite my code and could benefit from referencing such because they may have similar projects, please let me know ASAP and I will happily do so when I have the chance!*
