# FPGA Temperature Sensor Project

First ever Vivado project, planned and developed in 2 weeks in March 2024

*Looking back 6 months later, if I were to redo this project, I would incorporate a mix of combinational and sequential code in my "i2c_master.v" module as I did in my UART project in my "Digital-Logic-Projects" repository to make my Verilog more legible. If anyone looking at this code in the future would like me to actually do this and could benefit from it please let me know and I will happily do so in my free time
