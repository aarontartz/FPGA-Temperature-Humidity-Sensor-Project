# FPGA Temperature Sensor Project

First ever Vivado project, planned and developed in 2 weeks in March 2024

*Looking back 6 months later, if I were to redo this project, I would incorporate a mix of combinational and sequential code in my "i2c_master.v" module as I did in my UART project in my "Digital-Logic-Projects" repository to make my Verilog more legible. This project, being my introduction to Verilog, does not contain the most elegant code and is admittedly a bit brute-forced to fit the Si7021 I2C protocol...

If anyone looking at this in the future would like me to rewrite some parts of my code and could benefit from referencing such, please let me know ASAP and I will happily do so when I have the chance!
