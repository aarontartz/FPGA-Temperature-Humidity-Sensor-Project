# FPGA Temperature Sensor Project

First ever Vivado project, planned and developed in 2 weeks in March 2024

*Looking back 6 months later, I were to redo this project, I would incorporate a mix of combinational and sequential code like how I did in my UART project in my Digital-Logic-Projects repository to make this more legible
